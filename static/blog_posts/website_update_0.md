# My inignificant blog

*Posted: March 15, 2025*

I've added a blog section to my website to share my thoughts on machine learning, robotics, and other topics. I'll be posting about my experiences and learnings as I transition from academia to industry. I enjoy collecting my ideas in this format, as it provides a new way for me to think about the world and share my thoughts with others. Hopefully if you're reading this, you'll find some of my posts interesting!

As I'm growing, I want to be able to share my knowledge with others as well. I'll be starting to document any small ideas or demos that showcase some interesting concepts or technologies I've worked through in my work life or in my personal projects. Hopefully, you'll find some of these posts interesting!
