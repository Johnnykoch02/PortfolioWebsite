            <p>My name is Jonathan Koch and I am a B.S. in Computer Science Student at the University of South Florida. I love robots. I do research in Robotics; learning and perception in object maniplation. I am passionate about the future of robotics and AI in terms of generative action models devised to solve problems. My research focus has been in learning reperesentations of sensory data in armed robotics for enabling the learned ability of sophisticated manipulation tasks. I am actively searching for graduate roles and lab opportunites.</p>
            
            <p>Much of the work that has inspired me includes the itinerary of Sergey Levine from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@rail7462/videos">RAIL</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/research/emergent-tool-use"><b>Multi-Agent Emergent Tool Use</b></a> from OpenAI, <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-neuro-092920-120559"><b>Human Representation Learning</b></a> from Dr. Angela Radulescu at Princeton, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442.pdf"><b>Generative Agents</b></a> from Stanford Lab. <br><br>My passions outside of Computer Science include classical music, playing the guitar, and brazilian ju-jistu. I also find inspiration in the nostolagic game of Minecraft, and much of my work in this field has stemmed from my interest in this game. Below, you will find a brief timeline of my professional developments.
