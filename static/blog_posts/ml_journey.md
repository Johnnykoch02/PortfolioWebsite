# My Journey into Machine Learning

*Posted: July 1, 2024*

## The Beginning

My journey into machine learning began in late high school when I got into bot-building for PC games that I played. I was motivated by the benefits it provided me in the game, but quickly realized that the same principles could be applied to other problems. In college, I was fascinated by the concept of teaching computers to learn from data and make decisions. The theoretical foundations of ML - from linear algebra to calculus to probability theory - provided a robust framework that appealed to my analytical mind.

## Early Projects

My first significant long-term project involved developing a reinforcement learning algorithm for robotic object grasping and manipulation. Working in the Robot Perception and Action Laboratory (RPAL), I implemented an actor-critic architecture that allowed a Barrett Hand to learn grasping strategies through trial and error.

### Actor-Critic 
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class ActorCritic(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, action_dim):
        super(ActorCritic, self).__init__()
        self.shared_layers = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_dim, 128),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(128, 64),
            nn.ReLU()
        )
        
        # Actor head
        self.actor = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(64, action_dim),
            nn.Softmax(dim=-1)
        )
        
        # Critic head
        self.critic = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(64, 1)
        )
        
    def forward(self, x):
        features = self.shared_layers(x)
        action_probs = self.actor(features)
        state_value = self.critic(features)
        return action_probs, state_value
```

The Actor-Critic paridigm became a powerful idea in my mind to learn about, as the promise of being able to maximize the return of an agent in a given environment was too exciting of an idea. Being able to work with graduate students to develop and iterate on robotic agents was the main reason I chose to pursue a career in Deep Learning.


## Transitioning to Industry

After graduating, I joined Topaz Labs where I've been applying deep learning to image enhancement problems. The transition from academic research to industry applications brought new challenges:

1. **Scale**: Working with massive datasets and distributed training
2. **Efficiency**: Optimizing models for production environments
3. **Business Impact**: Translating technical improvements into user value

## Current Research Interests

My current focus is on multi-modal learning and representation learning. I'm particularly interested in how we can build models that understand both the visual and semantic content of media, enabling more intelligent processing and enhancement.

I believe the future of AI is in systems that can understand multiple forms of data and reason about their relationships. As I continue my career, I hope to contribute to making such systems a reality.
