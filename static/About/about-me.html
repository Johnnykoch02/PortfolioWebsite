            <p>
                My name is Jonathan Koch and I am a fourth-year Computer Science Student at the University of South Florida. I do research in Robotics and Deep Learning focusing on reinforcement learning and its applications to different agent environments. I am passionate about the future of robotics and AI in terms of generative models devised to solve problems. Much of the work that has inspired me includes <a href="https://openai.com/research/emergent-tool-use"><b>Multi-Agent Emergent Tool Use</b></a> from OpenAI, <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-neuro-092920-120559"><b>Human Representation Learning</b></a> from Dr. Angela Radulescu at Princeton, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442.pdf"><b>Interactive Simulacra</b></a> from Stanford Lab. <br><br>My passions outside of Computer Science include classical music, playing the guitar, and brazilian ju-jistu. I also find inspiration in the nostolagic game of Minecraft, and much of my work in this field has stemmed from my interest in this game. Below, you will find a brief timeline of my professional developments.

                        <p>The purpose of this group is to promote the discussion and development of AI on college campuses through the IEEE Student Chapters. Our mission is to enable students to learn and develop with AI technologies and provide an environment where AI project development can occur. Also, the group will participate in one main project a year where students can collaborate on different aspects of software, hardware and engineering. We extended this collaboration to other universities such as ... via open-source software and extension of GPU access.</p>
