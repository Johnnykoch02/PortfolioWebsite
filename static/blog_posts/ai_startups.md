# AI Startups and Semantics

*Posted: December 15, 2024*

Over the past few years, I've been deeply involved in the AI startup ecosystem, working with companies that are leveraging artificial intelligence to solve real-world problems. The rapid advancement of AI technologies has created unprecedented opportunities for entrepreneurs to build innovative solutions across various industries.

## My Technical Experience with AI Startups

1. **Embedding-based systems**: Using vector representations to enable semantic understanding and matching across different data types
2. **Fine-tuned language models**: Adapting pre-trained models for specific domains while maintaining efficiency and cost-effectiveness
3. **Robust retrieval architectures**: Combining semantic search capabilities with traditional structured data filtering

What's fascinating is how the acceleration of AI progress has transformed what's possible. Ten years ago, building sophisticated AI systems required massive resources and specialized expertise. Today, even small teams can leverage powerful open-source models and tools to create compelling products. The democratization of AI has lowered barriers to entry, but has also intensified competition.

## Key Focus Areas in My Recent Work

In my current projects, I've been concentrating on:

- Building scalable data processing pipelines that can handle millions of records efficiently
- Developing natural language interfaces that make complex data accessible through conversational queries
- Creating systems that identify patterns and insights that traditional approaches might miss

## Scaling Challenges

As with any technology startup, scaling AI systems presents unique challenges:
At Hirebase, we grew from processing a few tens of thousands of jobs to over 180,000k daily. This growth brought with it significant scaling challenges:

```
• Scraping infrastructure needed massive parallelization
• Inference costs threatened to outpace revenue
• Data quality issues amplified with scale
```

Solving these problems is always a challenge, but we were able to overcome them by continuously iterating on our models and infrastructure to drive the overhead costs down and improve the quality of our data. My intution here is to always look for components in your system that are driving up your costs and try to find ways to reduce them. Never be afraid to `Ctr+A` and `Del`.

## Looking Forward

The future of AI in recruitment is moving toward ever more personalized experiences. My piece in this is to become as talented as possible in the semantic search space. At every business and organization I've worked at, I've seen a massive amount of untapped potential in this space, and many times its been part of a core value proposition that drives revenue for the business. Currently, this is my main focus; semantic search over large datasets of structured information will drive a ton of value for existing and new businesses alike.

## My perspective on the semantic search and retrieval space

1. I believe in focusing relentlessly on user problems, not technology
2. I believe in building rapid feedback mechanisms into your product and allow this to drive your product development
3. I believe in being willing to always try something new if you're not seeing the returns you want
4. I believe in preparing for the "cold start" problem with any recommendation system, and be willing to iterate on your data collection strategy and model updates to improve your system
5. I believe in the importance of data quality and coverage. Anybody can build a simple recomendation system, but building the best system requires a deep understanding of the problem you're trying to solve and constantly improving the quality of the models your builing.
